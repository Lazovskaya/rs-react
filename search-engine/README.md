# Crypto Search Engine

Description:

A simple React web application that allows users to search for crypto coins definitions using an input field and view the search results. The application provides a clean and intuitive user interface with two main sections: a search bar for input and a results section for displaying search results. Users can search for items, and the application stores the search term in local storage for future reference. Additionally, the application includes error handling and a button to trigger intentional errors for testing purposes.

Features:

Search for items using a user-friendly input field.
Display search results in an organized manner.
Save the search term in local storage for easy retrieval.
Error handling with a button to simulate errors for testing.

Usage:

To use this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Run npm install to install dependencies.
Start the application using npm run dev.
Allowed search input needs to be downcase only, examples: 'bitcoin', 'etherium','dogecoin'.
